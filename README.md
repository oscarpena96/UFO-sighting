# UFO-sighting
# Overview
Do you believe in extraterrestrial life? If you do this project is just for you, here you can find a database made from UFO sightings and you can read all about them to 
see where and when it happened just make sure to read more about it because this is only data from 2010 so you might find more and surprise yourself with all kind of
information.
This module was all thanks to Dana and her hunger for knowledge, not only for UFO but also for Javascript, HTML and CSS, altough HTML is not a lenguage by default is
still an ability needed to be able to communicate your data and your findings.
# Tools
- VSCode
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- D3 v.4.11.0
- bootstrap v.4.0.0 
# Results
The end result was 3 functions, the first one to build the table from scratch and have something to show at all times, the second one an update filter function that is
able to communicate with HTML to check each box and change the data with help of the third function, this one is the mastermind behind of the operation being able to 
filter the table with the input from the user. The last part was from D3 and it helps by detecting the event that we indicate it to and that is how the program works

# Summary 
The easy part was to create the HTML and decorating it with CSS, the hard part was to make it run with Javascript, the filterTable function had a difficult part with the
loop but managable.
2 Updates that will be better for the user, that each box has a drop menu for him to be able to see the options and getting more information from an API call instead of
having a database.
